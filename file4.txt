      The Molière radius [5] gives the scale of the transverse dimension of the fully electromagnetic shower initiated by an incident high energy electron or photon. For the shower maximum the value of s=1 was considered.
      In the graph is presented the variation of Molière radius with the height.
      The Molière radius increases exponentially with altitude. This means that shower broadens higher up in the atmosphere.
