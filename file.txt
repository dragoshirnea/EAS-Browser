Atmospheric depth [1]

      -     is a measure of the path length that would help us predict the absorption of particles;
      -     at any point along the path the number of interactions is proportional to the density times the path length;

      In the graph it was used the expression of atmospheric depth as function of height [1]. The atmospheric depth where an air shower grows higher is located closer to the sea level.
