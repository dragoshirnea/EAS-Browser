# EAS-Browser

EAS Browser Display is a GUI (graphical user interface) made in QT, designed to make easier access to information about Extensive Air Showers-EAS and their properties. The browser offers basic information about how an Extensive Air Shower is created, their properties and geometry, and also about the detection techniques used at the Pierre Auger Observatory, to analize and understand better the ultra high energy cosmic rays, particles that generate the Extensive ait Showers.
For easier understanding, EAS-Browser offers graphic and video support. 

# Purpose

The EAS Browser Display was made within a 3 months long summer project in 2017 by the student Hîrnea Dragoș from Faculty of Physics, University of Bucharest, under the supervision of Senior Scientist Paula Gina Isar at the Institute of Space Science, Bucharest-Magurele. Partial contribution on data analysis was given by student Carla Lupu, from Faculty of Applied Sciences, Politechnica University of Bucharest. This GUI is designed to offer easy acces to informations about EAS and Pierre Auger Observatory, to anyone who wants to learn more or has a curiosity in Astrophysics.
