# EAS-Browser

EAS Browser Display is a GUI (graphical user interface) made in QT, designed to make easier acces to information about Extensive air Showers and their properties. The browser offers basic information about how an Extensive air Shower is created, their properties and geometry, and also about the detection techniques used at Pierre Auger Observatory, to analize and understand better the ultra high energy cosmic rays, particles that generate the Extensive ait Showers.
For easier understanding, EAS-Browser offers graphic and video support.
