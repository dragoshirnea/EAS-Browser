     If we rotate the coordinate axes [11] of the shower with the polarization angle [10], described in the “Geometry” section, VXB vector will be positioned along the  x-axis, which means that all the Geomagnetic contribution will be detected in the East-West polarization channel. This process can be observed on the left graph where X’ and Y’ are the new axes after rotation.
     Because VXB model describes only the Geomagnetic effect, after the rotation of the axis the signal on North-South polarization channel will be always zero.
