      VXB model describes the Geomagnetic emission by a simple cross product between the shower axis vector (v) and the Earth's magnetic field vector (B).
      The result of this product is called the v x B vector. The amplitude of the v x B vector is proportional to the geomagnetic angle and it represents the intensity of the signal. v x B is always oriented in the direction of the Lorentz force. 
      v x (v v B) vector is always perpendicular on v x B. This vector is of interest because if a radio station is placed alongside the v x (v x B) projection in the detection plane, the radio signals generated by the Geomagnetic and Askaryan effects will be distinguished and detected separately in the E-W and N-S polarisation channels.
