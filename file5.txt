        When extensive air showers (EAS) propagate through the Earth's atmosphere they emit radio waves, which can be detected with simple shaped radio antennas in the low frequency band of 20-80 MHz.
        The radio waves emitted by EAS have two main emission mechanisms: the Geomagnetic and Askaryan [A.5].
        When electrons and positrons in the shower have an accelerated motion in opposite directions by Lorentz force exerted by the Geomagnetic field, they emit radio waves. This process is called the Geomagnetic effect.
        The Askaryan emission is given by the net negative charge excess in the shower front. This excess of electrons is build up from rapid annihilations of positrons and supplementary production of electrons through ionization processes.
        The main difference between these two radio emission mechanisms is the polarization of the radio waves. Geomagnetic radio waves are linearly polarized in the direction of the Lorentz force, while the Askaryan radio waves are radially polarized along the shower axis.
        We present a simplified v x B model [8], which describes the Geomagnetic emission by a cross product between the shower axis vector (v) and the Earth's magnetic field vector (B).
        The amplitude of the cross product vector depends on the azimuth and geomagnetic angles.
        V x (v x B) vector [9] is always perpendicular on v x B. This vector is of interest because if a radio station is placed alongside the v x (v x B) projection in the detection plane, the radio signals generated by the Geomagnetic and Askaryan effects will be distinguished and detected separately in the E-W and N-S polarization channels.
