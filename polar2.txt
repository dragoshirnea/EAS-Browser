        The polar graph displayed it’s a representation of East-West projection of v x B vector [8.a], as function of azimuth for different zenith angles, color coded by amplitude. For the location of the Pierre Auger Observatory (B-field azimuth = 90 degrees, zenith = 54 degrees), the East-West polarization channel has a maximum recorded from showers coming mainly from the South, i,e from the opposite direction of the magnetic field (*B-field), and with zenith of about 40 degrees.
